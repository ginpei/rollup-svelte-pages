# rollup-svelte-pages

Issue: if you have an array as rollup.js config, and when you modify component style, output CSS files are not updated.

## How to see

Preparation:

1. `npm ci`

Try:

1. `npm run clean && npm start`
2. [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000)
3. Open `/foo.html` and `/bar.html` there
4. Make sure there are same headers in both pages
5. Modify header style at `Header.svelte` (e.g. change `background-color` from `#000` to `#999`)
6. The header on `/foo.html` changed
7. The header on `/bar.html` did NOT change
   - Its output file `bundle.css` was actually not output at this time

## How to fix

A plugin `rollup-plugin-css-only` doesn't seem to work for multiple inputs. Generating plugin instance for each input fixes this issue. This might affect bundle time.

```diff
- const plugins = [svelte({ preprocess: autoPreprocess() }), resolve(), css()];
+ const plugins = [svelte({ preprocess: autoPreprocess() }), resolve()];
```

```diff
  /** @type {import('rollup').RollupOptions} */ ({
  â€¦
-   plugins,
+   plugins: [...plugins, css()],
  })
```
